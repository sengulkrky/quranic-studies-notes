### Belief is unavoidable in any religion
***
All religions depend on believing in something you cannot see. That is not a weakness — it is the definition of belief. If God were 100% provable in a scientific way, belief would no longer be a choice. Everyone would believe automatically, and faith would lose its meaning.

Because of this, it is normal that religions ask people to accept certain claims on faith. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all do this in different ways. The issue is **not** that belief is required. The issue is **how belief is structured and where it is placed**.
### Christianity requires belief at multiple levels
***
In Christianity, belief does not stop at believing in God or in Jesus. It also requires belief in a long chain of human transmission and interpretation.

A Christian is asked to believe:
- that Jesus taught certain things
- that his followers correctly understood him
- that later writings accurately represented his message
- that church leaders preserved and interpreted this message correctly
- that church councils made the right decisions about doctrine
- that disagreements and changes were still guided by God

This means belief is not placed only in God, but also **repeatedly placed in human decisions and institutions**.
### The problem with human additions
***
Christian doctrine developed over time. Core beliefs — such as Jesus being God or the Trinity — were debated for centuries and eventually formalized by church councils. These councils were made up of humans who disagreed, argued, and corrected earlier views.

Christians explain this by saying the Holy Spirit guided the Church. But the Church itself admits that humans are imperfect and that mistakes have been made in history. This creates a tension:

**How can something imperfect define something perfect?**

Belief in Christianity therefore includes trusting that:
- human disagreement was still divinely guided
- later theology reflects what Jesus truly intended
- institutions did not distort core beliefs

This is not belief in God alone — it is belief **in God working through fallible structures**.
### Believing once versus believing again and again
***
This is where the contrast with Islam becomes clear.

Islam asks for belief mainly at one central point:  
that God revealed a message and preserved it.

Once that belief is accepted, everything else is measured against that fixed revelation. No later authority can redefine who God is or change the core message. The faith commitment is **front-loaded**.

Christianity, by contrast, spreads belief across history. A believer must repeatedly trust that humans at different times correctly understood, preserved, and finalized God’s message. Faith is not placed once, but **again and again**, each time involving human judgment.
### Why believing in preserved revelation feels different
***
Believing that God preserved a revelation is a single, clear leap of faith:  
either God protected His message, or He did not.

Believing in Christianity’s development requires trusting a chain of people:  
that they did not misunderstand Jesus,  
that they did not mix culture and philosophy into theology,  
that they did not make decisive errors,  
and that their disagreements were still part of God’s plan.

The longer the chain, the more room there is for error. Over time, belief shifts away from trusting God directly and toward trusting institutions to speak for God.
### Faith should be centered on God, not institutions
***
This critique is not saying Christianity is false, and it is not denying the sincerity of Christian belief. It is questioning **where faith is ultimately placed**.

If belief is unavoidable anyway, it feels more reasonable to place that belief in God’s ability to preserve His message than in humanity’s ability to interpret, correct, and define it over centuries.

The issue is not faith itself, but **how much faith is required in human authority**.
