My view is that belief in God and revelation should be grounded in **clear guidance from God**, not in layers of later human interpretation that become “truth” mainly because institutions declared them so. I don’t reject Jesus, on the contrary, I respect him deeply and I believe God truly sent him with guidance (the Injīl). What I struggle to accept is how Christianity, over time, became a religion whose most central doctrines depend heavily on **later writings, later interpretations, and later church authority**, rather than on what Jesus clearly taught.
### Jesus' message versus later doctrine
***
If Jesus was a messenger of God, then the most important beliefs about God and salvation should be **clear in his own teaching**. But Christianity’s core claims—especially “Jesus is God” and the Trinity—are not presented as simple, explicit teachings of Jesus. Jesus prays to God, submits to God, and speaks of God as someone other than himself. That fits naturally within the Old Testament’s monotheistic worldview. It makes it very plausible that Jesus intended people to continue within that prophetic tradition: worship one God, repent, live righteously, and return to sincere devotion.

The problem is that Christianity later asks people to accept doctrines that go far beyond that prophetic simplicity—doctrines that even many Christians describe as “mysteries” that cannot be fully understood. To me, that raises a basic question: why would God make the foundation of faith depend on concepts that require philosophical terms and later councils to define?
### The New Testament problem: revelation versus interpretation
***
A second issue is the nature of Christianity’s sources. Jesus did not leave behind a revealed book in his own words. The New Testament emerges later, written across decades by multiple authors in different communities and languages. These writings are not the Gospel in the sense of “a book Jesus delivered,” but texts **about Jesus** and reflections on what he meant. This matters because it means the religion is built on a chain of transmission that includes memory, interpretation, community agendas, and theological development.

So the question becomes: if salvation depends on the message, why would God allow the message to become something that needs centuries of sorting, compiling, and debating before it even becomes a fixed canon?
### Paul's influence: a religion shaped by someone who never met Jesus
***
This concern becomes stronger when you look at Paul’s role. Paul never lived with Jesus and did not learn directly from him in his lifetime. Yet Paul’s writings are among the earliest Christian texts we have, and they heavily shape Christian theology—especially the emphasis on salvation through Jesus’ death and resurrection, faith versus law, and a more cosmic framing of Jesus’ significance.

That feels like a major shift: Christianity becomes not only the teachings Jesus preached, but a theological system developed **after** him, explained largely by people who did not walk with him. Even if Paul was sincere, it is hard to see why a true religion from God would depend so strongly on a later interpreter’s authority—especially when early Christian communities clearly had disagreements.
### Councils and the "Holy Spirit guided it" claim
***
The biggest contradiction, in my view, appears in how Christianity justifies its certainty. When Christians say the Holy Spirit guided councils like Nicaea, that often sounds like a faith claim used to guarantee the outcome. But historically, councils look like human processes: political pressure, factions, voting, enforcement, condemnation of opponents. The claim “the Holy Spirit guided it” cannot be independently verified; it functions as a way to make institutional decisions unquestionable.

And this creates a circular structure:
- The church’s doctrine is true because the council decided it.
- The council is trustworthy because the Holy Spirit guided it.
- We know the Holy Spirit guided it because the council produced the correct doctrine.


That feels like the church validating itself by appealing to a divine guarantee that the church itself defines. If the councils were truly guided, why did Christians need multiple councils over centuries to refine and settle disputes? Why would God’s nature require votes and creeds?
### Fallible humans being treated as infallible authority
***
This leads to a deeper contradiction: Christianity often asks believers to trust church authority as if it is protected from error in the most important matters. Yet churches and church leaders are plainly human and historically fallible. If they can be wrong about many things, how can people be confident they are never wrong precisely where it matters most—God’s nature, salvation, and who Jesus is?

To me, a religion from God should not require the believer to place ultimate trust in fallible institutions and historically messy processes. If “truth” depends on church power structures to survive, that’s a red flag. True revelation should stand on its own clarity and preservation, not on institutional enforcement.
### Why this makes Islam feel more coherent
***
This is why the Islamic framing makes more sense to me. Islam maintains that God sent earlier revelation—Torah and Gospel—as real guidance for their communities, but that over time, human handling introduced disagreement, exaggeration, and confusion. So the Qur’an comes as a final clarification, a criterion, and a preserved reference point. It offers a simpler and more direct structure of authority: revelation defines core beliefs; scholars explain but do not create creed; no council can redefine God.

Most importantly, Islam does not require complex metaphysics to preserve monotheism. God is one, not divided. Jesus is honored as Messiah and prophet, not turned into an object of worship. And faith does not depend on trusting that centuries-later institutions were divinely guided despite political realities.
### My conclusion
***
So my position is not “Christianity is stupid” or “Christians are insincere.” Many Christians are sincere and morally serious. My issue is structural: Christianity as we have it today seems to rely on a long chain of human interpretation and institutional authority to define its most central beliefs—especially beliefs that Jesus did not clearly teach in straightforward terms.

If God’s guidance is meant to be a mercy and a light, it should be clear, protected, and not dependent on councils, votes, philosophical frameworks, and circular claims of authority. That’s why I find it more reasonable to believe in the original prophetic message—one God, prophets as messengers, moral responsibility, accountability—than to accept later theological developments as binding truth simply because the church declared them so.
