### Jesus and authority
***
- Can you show me where Jesus explicitly says he is God, in clear and unambiguous words, rather than through later interpretation?
- If Jesus never wrote a book and never explained complex doctrines like the Trinity, how do we know later interpretations accurately reflect his intent?
- Why would God allow the most important beliefs about Jesus' nature to remain unclear during his lifetime, only to be defined centuries later?
### The Holy Spirit and councils
***
- How do we know the Holy Spirit guided the councils, rather than the councils defining what the Holy Spirit is supposed to have guided?
- If a council’s authority depends on the Holy Spirit, but the understanding of the Holy Spirit depends on the council, how is that not circular reasoning?
- Why should I trust a doctrine decided by voting and political enforcement as divine, rather than as a human attempt to settle disagreement?
### Paul's role
***
- Why is Christianity so heavily based on Paul’s writings when he never met Jesus during his lifetime?
- If Paul disagreed with Jesus’ original disciples on key issues, why should his interpretation be treated as authoritative?
- Is Christianity following the religion Jesus practiced, or a religion developed about Jesus after his death?
### Scripture and preservation
***
- Why would God allow His final guidance to be spread across dozens of writings, languages, and authors, requiring centuries to agree on what counts as scripture?
- If the message was essential for salvation, why wasn’t it preserved clearly from the start?
- How do we separate divine revelation from human interpretation if both are mixed in the same texts?
### Reason and belief
***
- Should truth require institutional authority to survive, or should it be clear enough to stand on its own?
- If belief depends on trusting a process I cannot verify, how is that different from blind faith?
- Why would God require belief in concepts that even theologians call “mysteries beyond understanding”?
