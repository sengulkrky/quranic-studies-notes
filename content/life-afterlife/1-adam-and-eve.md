### The concept of original sin in the bible
***
Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This act introduced sin, death and seperation between God and humanity.

Original sin does not mean that people are personally guilty of Adam and Eve's act.
It means:
- Humans are born into a sinful condition or nature
- We have an inclination toward sin
- The world itself is broken by sin

```
Romans 5:12
“Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned.”
```

### The "fall" in the quran
***
```
But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the ˹blissful˺ state they were in,1 and We said, “Descend from the heavens ˹to the earth˺ as enemies to each other.2 You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.” (2:36)
```
