### A guide
***
The following verses tell us exactly what the Quran is:
```
This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺, who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them, and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter. (2:2-4)
```

- A guide and good news for the believers
- Confirms what came before
