Allah sets clear ethical boundaries to protect both spouses. Crossing these boundaries for example mistreating the wife, reclaiming dowry unfairly or abusing divorce is considered sinful and unjust.

```
Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles ˹before they can re-marry˺. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree ˹of responsibility˺ above them. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise. (2:228)
```
### Iddah period
***
The iddah period is a waiting time for a woman after divorce before she can remarry.

Purposed of the iddah:
1. Ensure no pregnancy from the previous husband
2. Provide time for emotional reflection and reconciliation
3. Maintain social and family stability
### Transparency
***
Women must reveal if they are pregnant so inheritance, lineage and rights are clear and protected.
### Opportunity for reconciliation
***
During the iddah, a husband can revoke the divorce and resume the marriage without a new contract. This allows reconciliation and preservation of marriage if both agree.
### Equitable rights
***
Islam promotes fair rights for both genders in marriage and divorce. The "degree of responsibility" refers to financial and social responsibility of men as providers and protectors.
### Rules
***
A husband can reconcile with his wife after divorce twice. After the third divorce, it is permanent. Either he keeps her honorably, meaning no further divorce without valid reasons. Or they separate with dignity, observing proper procedures and fairness. This prevents impulsive or repeated divorces.

```
Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace. It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah. So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. (2:229)
```

Fathers are responsible for supporting the mother financially after divorce. This ensures the mother is not burdened while caring for the child.

```
˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years, for those who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their child˺. The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother ˹during that period˺... (2:233)
```

Even if there is no child, divorced women should be looked after.

```
Reasonable provisions must be made for divorced women—a duty on those mindful ˹of Allah˺. (2:241)
```
### Dowry (mahr)
***
Dowry is the wife's right; it cannot be reclaimed by the husband after divorce. The wife can pay compensation (khula') if needed, but it must not be exploitative.
### Divorce before consummation
***
If the marriage hasn't been consummated sexually, or the dowry hasn't been fully paid divorce does not carry sin. Even if the marriage isn't consummated, the woman should receive fair compensation that matches the husband's financial capacity. 

```
There is no blame if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated or the dowry is settled. But give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation—the rich according to his means and the poor according to his. A reasonable compensation is an obligation on the good-doers. (2:236)
```

If the marriage hasn't been consummated, but the dowry has been decided, the husband must pay half of it. Being generous or forgiving is ethically and spiritually rewarded. 

```
And if you divorce them before consummating the marriage but after deciding on a dowry, pay half of the dowry, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays in full. Graciousness is closer to righteousness. (2:237)
