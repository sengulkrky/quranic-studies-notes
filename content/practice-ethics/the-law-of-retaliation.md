O believers! ˹The law of˺ retaliation is set for you in cases of murder—a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female.1 But if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian,2 then blood-money should be decided fairly3 and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment. (2:178)
```

The **law of retaliation** in the Qur’an is known as **“Qisas” (قصاص)**. It is a principle of **justice in criminal cases**, particularly involving **intentional murder or bodily harm**. The idea is often summarized as **“an eye for an eye”**, but in the Qur’an it is more nuanced and balanced by mercy.
### Key principles of Qisas
***
**1. Proportionality**
- Punishment must match the crime
**2. Justice with limits**
- Only applies to intentional acts, not accidents
- Must be carried through a legal process, not personal vengeance
**3. Option for forgiveness**
- The family of the victim can forgive the offender
- Forgiveness is highly encouraged and considered a meritorious act
- A monetary compensation can be accepted instead
**4. Equality before the law**
- The Quran emphasizes that the law applies regardless of social status, gender or ethnicity

### Why it exists
***
1. To limit revenge: Qisas replaces uncontrolled retaliation with a regulated legal framework
2. To protect human life: the severity of punishment discourages intentional harm
3. To promote mercy: forgiveness and compensation are always encouraged over bloodshed

### Does Christianity have a similar system?
***
The Old Testament includes the law of proportional retaliation, similar to Qisas. The Old Testament’s law is similar to Qisas in principle: proportional punishment, legal regulation, and fairness.
