The following verse:
- Confirms the core truths found in earlier revelations (the Torah and other scriptures originally given by god)
- It does not abolish their true message (belief in one god, moral law, prophets)
- Muhammad's message is presented as a continuation, not a contradiction

```
Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures. Do not be the first to deny them or trade them for a fleeting gain. And be mindful of Me. (2:41)
```

So God is telling the children of Israel to recognize this revelation as coming from the same God they already believe in.

💡Israel is the name given to the prophet Jacob (Ya'qub)
💡The children of Israel refers to the Jews 

```
Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians1—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. (2:62)
```

#### Eating pork
Eating pork is also forbidden in the Old Testament in Leviticus 11:7-8 and Deuteronomy 14:8

```
Leviticus 11:7-8

And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.
```

```
Deuteronomy 14:8

The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
```
