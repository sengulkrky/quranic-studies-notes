### The Old Testament and prophetic religion
***
The Old Testament represents a long prophetic tradition centered on strict monotheism. God is one, transcedent and separate from creation. Prophets are human messengers chosen to guide their people, not divine beings. The purpose of revelation is moral guidance, law and accountability. Salvation is tied to obedience, repentance and justice rather than belief in a specific individual's death.

Within this framework, prophets do not redefine God's nature. They call people back to worship, ethical conduct and covenantal responsibility. Authority lies in revelation itself, not in later interpretation or institutions. 

This is the religious world into which Jesus was born. 
### Jesus and the original Gospel message
***
Historically, Jesus lived and taught as a Jewish preacher addressing Jewish audiences. He spoke within the language and worldview of the Old Testament. He prayed to God, submitted to God and distinguished himself clearly from God. He did not present himself as divine, nor did he explain God in metaphysical terms. His mission was moral and spiritual reform: repentance, righteousness, humility and sincere devotion to the one God. 

The Gospel, from both an Islamic and historical perspective, refers to the divine guidance revealed to Jesus himself. It was not a written book authored by Jesus, nor was it presented as a final, universally preserved scripture. Like earlier revelations, it was guidance for a specific people in a specific context, transmitted through teaching, memory and practice.

At this stage, there was no "New Testament", no Trinity and no formal doctrine about Jesus' nature. Faith was lived, not systematized.
### The crisis after Jesus and the need for interpretation
***
After Jesus' death, his followers were confronted with difficult questions. If Jesus was the Messiah, why was he executed? What did his death mean? How should his teachings relate to the existing law? What role should non-Jews play in this movement?

These questions could not be answered clearly from the Old Testament alone, and Jesus himself had left no written revelation to settle them. As Christianity spread beyond its Jewish roots into the Greco-Roman world, new cultural and philosophical frameworks entered the discussion.

It is here that interpretation began to replace direct revelation as the primary driver of belief.
### Paul and the transformation of Christianity
***
A decisive turning point came with Paul. Paul never lived with Jesus, never heard his teachings directly, and was not among his original disciples. His authority rested on a claimed vision of the risen Jesus after Jesus' death. 

Despite this, Paul became the most influential figure in shaping Christian theology. His letters are the earliest Christian writings we possess, predating the Gospels. In them, Jesus' mission is reframed. The focus shifts from ethical reform and devotion to God toward salvation through Jesus' death and resurrection. Observance of Jewish law is deemphasized, belief becomes central and Jesus is described in increasingly exalted, cosmic terms.

Christianity becomes less the religion practiced by Jesus and more a religion about Jesus. This transformation is not the result of a single decision, but of theological momentum driven largely by Pauline thought.
### The New Testament as a response to theological change
***
The New Testament emerged to support this evolving belief system. The Gospels were written decades after Jesus, by multiple authors, in different communities and in a language Jesus did not speak. They are not revelations delivered by Jesus, but reflections on his life and significance shaped by the beliefs of their communities.

Over time, letters and narratives that aligned with dominant theology were collected, while others were excluded. This process was gradual and contested. The New Testament became necessary because Christianity had moved beyond what the Old Testament could support on its own. New beliefs required new textual foundations.
### Church councils and the shift of authority
***
Disagreements over Jesus' nature eventually became impossible to contain. Was Jesus human, divine or something in between? How could monotheism survive if Jesus was worshipped?

To resolve these conflicts, church leaders convened councils, the most famous being the Council of Nicaea. These councils did not merely interpret scripture, they defined doctrine. Positions were debated, voted on and enforced with political power. One interpretation became orthodox, while others were labeled heretical and suppressed.

At this point, authority decisively shifted. Belief was no longer grounded primarily in prophetic revelation, but in institutional definition. Scripture was read through doctrine, rather than doctrine emerging transparently from scripture.

Christians later justified these decisions by claiming the Holy Spirit guided the councils. This claim, however, is a matter of faith rather than historical verification. Accepting it requires trust in institutional authority rather than direct revelation.
### Jesus within the Old Testament framework
***
There is no evidence that Jesus intended to:
- Start a new religion
- Replace Israel's scripture with a new canon
- Redefine God's nature
- Abolish prophetic monotheism

In fact, the earliest sources portray him as someone calling people back to God, not away from Him.

One of the clearest statements attributed to Jesus is that he came to uphold, not discard what already existed. In the Gospel tradition, he presents himself as fulfilling the Law, not replacing it. Fulfillment here does not mean cancellation, it means restoring sincerity, intention and obedience.

This strongly suggest that Jesus expected his followers to remain grounded in the Old Testament worldview.
### No evidence Jesus wanted "new theology"
***
Crucially Jesus never:
- Explained God as tri-personal
- Spoke about divine essence or metaphyics
- Taught salvation through belief in his death
- Claimed his words would replace scripture
- Announced a coming "New Testament"

Those developments only appear after his death, when followers began trying to explain what had happened to him.

This distinction matters a lot.

Jesus preached repentance, humility, justice and devotion to God, all core Old Testament themes. Nothing in his teaching requires a new theological system to make sense.
### What changed was not Jesus, it was the situation after him
***
The turning point was not Jesus' message, but his execution.

Once Jesus died, his followers were forced to answer questions he never addressed explicitly:
- Why would God allow this?
- What does this mean for salvation?
- Was Jesus more than a prophet?
- How does this fit with scripture?

Those questions produced interpretations, not new revelation.

This is where new ideas began to form, especially through figures like Paul and where theology slowly shifted from "what Jesus taught" to "what Jesus meant".
### The Quranic perspective aligns closely
***
The Quran presents Jesus as a prophet who:
- Confirmed the Torah
- Called people back to God
- Did not introduce new theology
- Did not claim divinity

From this view, Jesus expected to remain faithful to existing revelation not invent new interpretations about his nature or death. Later theology is seen as human extrapolation, not divine instruction.
