```
And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,”1 so they all did—but not Iblîs,2 who refused and acted arrogantly,3 becoming unfaithful. (2:34)
```

The command to prostate was a test of obedience. Satan refused to prostate because he believed he was superior to Adam:
```
Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.” (7:12)
```
