Islam is often misunderstood as promoting violence, when in fact the Quran's teaching is much more nuanced.
### What the Quran really says about violence
***
1. Fighting is only permitted in defense, not as a first resort
```
Fight in the cause of Allah ˹only˺ against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits.1 Allah does not like transgressors. (2:190)
```

2. Human life is highly valued and murder is strictly forbidden
```
That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. (5:32)
```

3. Peace is the goal
```
If the enemy is inclined towards peace, make peace with them. (8:61)
```

### Misunderstood verse (2:191)
***
```
Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is the reward of the disbelievers.
```

This verse was revealed when early Muslims in Mecca were **persecuted, tortured, expelled from their homes**, and attacked. They were not allowed to fight back for years. Eventually, they were driven into exile in Medina and even then, they were still attacked. So this verse addresses a **specific war situation**, not peaceful coexistence.

#### Surrounding verses to understand
```
Fight in the way of Allah **those who fight you**, but do not transgress. Allah does not love transgressors. (2:190)

But if they stop, then Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (2:192)

Fight against them ˹if they persecute you˺ until there is no more persecution, and ˹your˺ devotion will be to Allah ˹alone˺. If they stop ˹persecuting you˺, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors. (2:193)
```
#### What the verse does not mean:
- Kill non-muslims wherever you find them
- Violence against civilians
- Forced conversion
- Permanent war against unbelievers
#### The real message of the verse
If people violently persecute you, expel you from your homes, and attack you—even in sacred spaces—you are allowed to fight back to stop the oppression. But only against attackers, only proportionally, and only until the aggression ends.
