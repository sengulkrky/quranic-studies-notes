The Quran mentions slaves frequently, but the context and purpose are very important to understand. It's not because Islam glorifies slavery, it's because slavery already existed in 7th-century Arabia, and the Quran gradually regulated it and encouraged emancipation.
### Historical context
***
- At the time of the prophet, slavery was widespread across Arabia and the world
- Slaves were used for labor, domestic work and sometimes war captives
- Islam did not abolish slavery overnight, but introduced moral, legal and ethical reforms to protect slaves and encourage freeing them
### How the Quran addresses slavery
***
**1. Emphasis on freeing slaves**
The Quran repeatedly recommends freeing slaves as a good deed
```
Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, ˹needy˺ travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives... (2:177)
```

```
If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺! And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path is? It is to free a slave... (90:11-13)
```

**2. Gradual regulation of existing practices**
Marriage with slaves is mentioned in 2:221, where Allah tells us that marrying a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist. 

Slaves were given rights, protection and fair treatment which was a huge improvement over pre-Islamic practices.
- They could not be mistreated without punishment
- Their freedom could be granted
- They could marry and have families

**3. Morality and justice**
Many verses link slavery with ethical obligations:
- Treat slaves kindly
- Free them if you can
- Avoid abusing power over them
