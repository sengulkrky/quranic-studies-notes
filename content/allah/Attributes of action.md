### The mercy of Allah
***
```
As for those who repent, mend their ways, and let the truth be known, they are the ones to whom I will turn ˹in forgiveness˺, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. (2:160)
```

Repentance (tawbah) in Islam is not just feeling regret. It means:
- Recognizing the wrongdoing
- Feeling sincere remorse
- Turning back to God
- Making a firm intention not to repeat it

>No sin permanently closes the door to God.

Repentance must be backed by action:
- Correcting behavior
- Repairing harm done to others
- living differently going forward

God promises:
- Forgiveness is not partial
- God turns toward the person who turns back to him
- God repeatedly accepts repentance, even if a person falls again
- Mercy is God's defining attribute, not punishment

### Allah intends ease, not hardship (2:185)

```
Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. (2:286)
