### Human existence and the question of meaning
***
The question “Why did God create us?” already assumes that existence is not meaningless. Humans are not satisfied with merely surviving; they ask why they exist, why morality matters, why suffering feels unjust, and why death feels unfinished. Islam takes this impulse seriously and sees it as a sign that existence is **intentional**, not accidental.

The Qur’an consistently challenges the idea that creation is random or pointless. It asks whether humans truly believe they were created without purpose or return (23:115). From the Islamic perspective, the very fact that humans search for meaning points to a reality in which meaning exists.

```
Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?” (23:115)
```
### Creation was not out of God's need
***
Islam begins by making something very clear: God did not create humans because He needed them. God is described as completely independent of creation. Humans depend on God, not the other way around:

```
O humanity! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah ˹alone˺ is the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. (35:15)
```

This means creation is not about fulfilling a lack in God. It is an act of will, not necessity. Human existence is not meant to serve God’s ego or sustain Him in any way.
### Human uniqueness: freedom and responsibility
***
Humans are described in the Qur’an as bearing a responsibility that the rest of creation could not carry:

```
Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they ˹all˺ declined to bear it, being fearful of it. But humanity assumed it, ˹for˺ they are truly wrongful ˹to themselves˺ and ignorant ˹of the consequences˺, so that Allah will punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, and Allah will turn in mercy to believing men and women. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (33:72-73) 
```

This “trust” is understood as moral responsibility combined with free will. Humans are neither forced to obey like angels nor driven purely by instinct like animals. They can recognize truth, reject it, act justly, or act unjustly. This freedom is what gives real weight to human choices.
### Life as a test, not a punishment
***
Because humans have freedom, life is described as a test. But in Islam, a test is not about cruelty or constant punishment. It is what gives meaning to action and exposes what lies within a person:

```
˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving. (67:2)
```

The Qur’an does not say the test is about perfection or belief alone, but about conduct and sincerity. Without this testing space, concepts like justice, patience, courage, mercy, and integrity would remain abstract ideas rather than lived realities.
### Why this life is not the end
***
If life ended at death, much of human experience would be morally unresolved. Innocent people suffer, wrongdoers often escape justice, and good actions are not always rewarded. Islam argues that creation only makes sense if life is incomplete by design.

From this perspective, accountability and justice must exist beyond this world. Otherwise, existence would be deeply unjust and ultimately meaningless.
### Worship as orientation, not divine need
***
One of the most misunderstood statements in the Qur’an is that humans were created to worship God:

```
I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me. (51:56)
```

This does not mean God needs praise or ritual. The Qur’an immediately clarifies this:

```
I seek no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me. (5:57)
```

In Islam, worship means living in awareness of truth, responsibility, and accountability. It is not for God’s benefit, but for human alignment. Without orientation toward something higher than ego or power, human life easily collapses into injustice, meaninglessness, or self-worship.
### Struggle, limitation, and divine wisdom
***
Islam does not deny that life contains hardship, confusion, and struggle. Instead, it places these within a broader framework of divine wisdom that humans cannot fully see:

```
Fighting has been made obligatory upon you ˹believers˺, though you dislike it. Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know. (2:216)
```

At the same time, the Qur’an insists that God is not unjust:

```
Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves. (10:44)
```

Human suffering is not presented as meaningless, even when its purpose is not immediately clear.
